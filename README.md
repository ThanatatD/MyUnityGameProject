## 💾 About the Project Source Files

Unfortunately, due to a technical issue with the developer’s computer 😢, the **original source files were lost**.

As these games were created primarily for practice and personal growth, **starting new projects** is more preferable than trying to **recover or recreate** what was already done.

That said, there is an **older backup version** (unfinished) of the project source files still available.

📩 If you are interested in viewing or exploring them, feel free to contact me via **personal email**.

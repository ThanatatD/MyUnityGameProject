# 🎮 Unity 2D Game Collection by Thanatat_D

This folder contains two 2D games created by me using Unity 2D, as part of my practice and learning journey in game development.

🧠 1. Alzheimer
A memory-based puzzle game where players must remember and press the correct pattern of 9 buttons that appear randomly. As rounds progress, the difficulty increases, challenging your brain with faster sequences and distractions. Use 3 special items to aid your memory.
Try hard not to be ALZHEIMER!

🐤 2. Chickshot Roulette
⚠️ Disclaimer: This game is inspired by the original game BUCKSHOT ROULETTE.
However, this version is redesigned as a mobile-friendly 2D game with a unique cute chick theme.
